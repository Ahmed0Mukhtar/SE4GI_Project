									<p style="text-align:justify;"> Stream assessments within the Pomperaug 
									Watershed support comprehensive evaluation of the physical, chemical and 
									biological characteristics of the watershed in relation to human health, ecological 
									conditions, and designated water uses. Documenting such characteristics will help establish 
									cause-and-effect relationships, evaluate the effectiveness of current and future remediation and 
									restoration activities, provide input for management tools such as models, and support 
									scientifically-based decisions for preserving and improving the quality of our local water resources.</p>

									<h2>bacteria and nitrate</h2>
									<hr />
									<p style="text-align:justify;">Nitrogen is an indicator of fertilizer runoff, septic failure, and animal waste. 
									Nitrogen is also a contaminant of major concern for Long Island Sound.
									Bacteria are an indicator of general water quality degradation from septic effluent and agricultural runoff, 
									which are the principle sources of contamination in the Pomperaug River.</p>
									<p>Targeted bacteria to sample: Escherichia coli <i>(E. coli)</i></p>
									
									<h3>Water Temperature</h3>
									<p style="text-align:justify;">Water temperature can also   be inherently variable as it is influenced by 
									factors including air temperature, riparian characteristics, and groundwater input. Water temperature 
									itself is an important variable in determining the biology of a particular stream segment.</p>


									<header>
										<h3><b>Escherichia coli (<i>E. coli</i>)</b></h3>
										<p>(Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, rod-shaped, coliform bacterium of the genus <b>Escherichia</b>)</p>
									</header>

									<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="image left"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kJjwg4h2ULvghvsHFT62HU-1200-80.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="210" /></span>It is the type of bacteria under study. Commonly found in the guts of all warm-blooded animals, including humans.
									<br><br>Most E.coli strains are harmless, and usually poses little concern to 
									humans with the exception of some serotypes (<i>EPEC, ETEC etc.</i>) that is capable of causing 
									illness. Prolonged exposure to or swallowing water containing high levels of E. coli can cause mild 
    								to severe symptoms that may present in a way similar to a stomach virus, an ear infection or a rash.</p>
									<p>Typical recovery is expected within a few days to over a week.</p>

									<p style="text-align:justify;">Its presence is used as the primary sanitary indicator for fresh water.
									High bacteria levels can indicate water quality degradation from pollutant sources such as agricultural runoff, septic contamination, and pet waste.</p>

									
									<p style="text-align:justify;">E.coli is tested because it is often an indicator for the presence of other, 
									more difficult to test for pathogensthat may cause waterborne illnesses to those swimming, wading, or boating.</p>

									<p>E. coli data are reported as "colony forming units per 100 mL" of water (or CFU / 100mL)</p>
									<h3><b>CFU and MPN:</b></h3>
									</header>
									
									<h4><b>Colony forming unit (CFU)</b></h4>
									<blockquote>is a parameter which measures the number of viable bacterial or fungal cells in a given sample.<br>The method which counts colony forming units is referred as standard plate count
									</blockquote>

									<h4><b>The most probable number (MPN)</b></h4>
									<blockquote>is an alternative measure to <i>CFU/ml</i>. Also estimates the viable cells in a liquid sample. It counts organisms growing in a liquid culture and is a predominantly bacteriological technique.<br>This method is particularly useful for samples which contain low concentrations of bacterial cells; for example, milk, potable water etc.
