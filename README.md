--BEFORE RUNNING THE SOFTWARE--
1 - PgAdmin should be installed on your computer :
        Open PgAdmin, and create a new database. Add Postgis extention in it. (we recommend you to call it se4g)

            geopandas,
            geopy,
            descartes,
            seaborn,
            contextily,
            requests,
            folium,
            flask,
            bokeh,
            git,
            geoalchemy2.
            
3- From the repository, download the file preprocessing.py, and modify the line 86, putting your actual username, password and database inside of the ones already written. Then run it.
